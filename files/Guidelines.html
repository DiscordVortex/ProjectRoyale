<font color='#99AAB5'>
  <li>
    Organizing and participating in raids/harrasment/abuse in our community would result in a <font color="#7289DA"><b>ban</b></font> from our community depending on the severity. 
      <li>Spamming in chat isn't allowed and you will be automatically muted for 10-5 minutes, staff may increase the mute if you continue.</li>
      <li>Swearing in our community is <font color="#7289DA"><b>NOT</b></font> permitted.</li>
      <li>Excessive inappropriate language or behavior - Please refrain from excessive or extreme behaviors in our community. To provide the best possible experience for our users, we require that you keep excessive inappropriate behaviors away from public channels. Some examples include: sexually explicit language, solicitation, racism or other prejudice, threatening behavior, blackmail and excessive swearing.</li>
      <li>Abuse of bots - We aim to provide the best possible interactive bots for our users.  Which means you can use these in appropriate channels.  If you wish to use the bot, we ask that this is done in #Bot-commands .  Abusing our bots will lead you to be <font color="#7289DA"><b>blacklisted</b></font> or removed from the community.</li>
      <li>Drama and Conflict - Please keep and leave the drama at home.  We also require our members to not instigate, stir, or create drama within the community.  Any member that is found creating a conflict on purpose or to instigate a derailment will find themselves <font color="#7289DA"><b>removed</b></font> from the community.</li>
      <li>Respect and Attention - Please treat each other with respect.  We all have different views, communication styles, and come from many backgrounds - we will not tolerate users that disrupt, troll, or derail the community.  Members are also required to not use our community like grindr to find hookups.  This community is not a safespace, please leave your social justice warrior traits at the door.</li>
      <li>Invitations to the Community - Our invitation system is open for use to have your friends join.  Abusing this system will result in your privilege taken away without notice.</li>
      <li>Self Bots - Self bots are not allowed within Vortex.</li>
      <li>We are a kind and respectful community, please keep it that way. </li>
      <li>Staff Respect - Please respect our staff and moderators.  If you disagree with an action taken by a moderator or treatment with a staff member, please raise this with another moderator or an admin.  Please do not message Vorpal or Frost as a first pass.</li>
      <li>Channels and Content - Keep all related content in the correct channels.</li>
